## 📂 Selected Projects

### 🛰️ 2D/3D Projectile Motion Simulator with Air Resistance (MATLAB)
> [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ozio1212/3D-Motion-Simulation)  
> A physics-based simulator of oblique projectile motion with air drag, supporting both 2D and 3D trajectories.  
Built in MATLAB using numerical ODE solving (`ode23`) and animated in real time.  
Includes user-defined input for mass, drag coefficient, initial velocity, and launch angles.  
The simulation visualizes the object’s motion and automatically exports an animated `.gif` of the trajectory.

### 🧮 Mini Casino – Console-Based Game (Python)
> [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ozio1212/mini_casino)  
A simple console-based casino simulation written in Python. Features basic game logic, betting mechanics, and randomization. Used to practice control structures and user input.
